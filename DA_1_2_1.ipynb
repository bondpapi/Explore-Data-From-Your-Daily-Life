Part 1\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The main objective of this sprint is to learn the fundamentals of using spreadsheets for data analytics work. The course will focus more on Google Spreadsheets, although some resources will talk about Microsoft Excel too. Google spreadsheets can be considered a lightweight version of Microsoft Excel, containing certain additional connectivity and sharing features making it a good tool for data collaboration. \n","\n","Techniques and skills learned in this module can be easily applied when working with both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and will cover the majority of functionalities needed by a data analyst.\n","\n","Spreadsheets is one of the most versatile tools to work with data and is broadly used for many specialties, not just data analyst. While your expertise & usage of spreadsheets will vary as a data analyst, knowing fundamentals is a must nowadays. For data analysts, spreadsheets can be used for:\n","\n","- **Working out the proof of concept**. Before jumping into building more complex SQL tables, queries, data flows and/or reporting solutions it might be helpful to visualize & test the idea more quickly in spreadsheets.\n","- **Presenting ad-hoc tasks**. Not all of your tasks need to end up as sustainable solutions, some may be just one-time deliveries/insights and spreadsheets can be ideal to present these findings more quickly.\n","- **Documentation, metadata & more**. While not too wide-spread, you may find that certain users may use spreadsheets for pretty much everything, including writing tutorials, documentations and other information – spreadsheets are certainly capable of that. \n","\n","There is also a notorious joke that the financial system is maintained by Excel. While it is certainly far fetched, the financial analysts have historically taken a liking into spreadsheets and their flexibility in their work. Spreadsheets however have certain limitations:\n","- **Big data**. Spreadsheets’ performance drops fast when starting to deal with more data. Once you move into 10k+ rows, the performance limitations become visible, 100k+ rows you may have to re-think needs for any live calculations. Since these numbers are anything but big, data analysts usually have to learn to use other tools such as SQL to select & aggregate data before moving it into spreadsheets.\n","- **Victim of its flexibility**. Nowadays connectivity and data availability can be key to bringing holistic, useful insights  & data driven decisions. Spreadsheets, however, allow for a user to store data in non-tabular and/or unstructured formats that SQL-based logic would disallow. If spreadsheets are used too much and not carefully enough, it can lead to valuable data and business information being stored in custom, messy spreadsheet files that make it unavailable for other types of use. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"P9mLkOBGyOQw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Required material:\n","- [Google Sheets - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2opj8XzYBY) 0:00:00 (Welcome) – 1:01:52 (Selecting & Moving Data)\n","\n","[*Approximate time to finish this part ~ 1 hour*]\n","\n","\n","## Optional resources for in-depth knowledge\n","- [Excel 2019 Bible](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/excel-2019-bible/9781119514787/). \n","  - *Note: you should have received an invitation to join O'Reilly with a Turing College provided licence to the email with which you registered for the course.
